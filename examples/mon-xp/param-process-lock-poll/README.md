Description
===========

Similar to the process-lock-poll experiment.
However in this case the balanced process is parametrized and the experiment started numerous
so that we can correlate the process working time with the average radio off delay.

Note it it reads ISR2POLL sometimes but it is truly ISR2OFF that is measured.
